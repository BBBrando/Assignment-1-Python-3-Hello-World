# Assignment #1: Learning Python 3

This assignment will get you up to speed on some Python3 basics, which should help with learning Django later this semester that is built upon Python and will require you to write your web server backend in Python3.

We are using Python3 vs Python2 as it is where the industry is going and projects are starting to support both with the expectation that a shift to Python3 will happen soon.


#Part 1: Dictionary

This problem is taken from: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/defaultdict-tutorial

Your method should take in values representing the following:

* aList = list of strings

Your method called *stringCount* should print out a sorted alphabetically list of the strings and the number of that string in the list separated by a space on each line.

For an example:

```python
alist = ["Hello", "Hello", "Bob"]
print(stringCount(alist))
```

This should print:

```
Bob 1
Hello 2
```
